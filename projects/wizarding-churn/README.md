# Customer Churn at a Wizarding School

This project predicts student churn (dropout risk) at a fictional wizarding school inspired by Hogwarts. It uses a synthetic dataset that includes house affiliation, magical grades, behavior, and club participation.

### Dataset

- `wizarding_students.csv` â€” 500 fictional students with:
  - House, blood status, course difficulty
  - Flying and Potions grades
  - Owl message frequency, dueling club membership
  - Churn label (0 = stayed, 1 = dropped out)

### Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Visuals: Histograms, confusion matrix, ROC curve
- Models: Logistic Regression & Decision Tree

### Notebook Contents

- EDA on magical performance and churn
- Modeling churn probability
- Feature importance analysis

> A fun, themed classification project that blends storytelling and machine learning.
