  - Founder experience, specialty, state
  - Target: `Defaulted` (1 = defaulted, 0 = paid)

### Highlights

- Default likelihood by credit grade
- Revenue and investment pattern visualization
- Gradient boosting classifier with feature importance

### Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Visuals: Boxplots, countplots, bar charts
