# Loan Default Prediction for Student Loans at Hogwarts

This project uses machine learning to predict default risk among students at a magical university. It explores financial behaviors, academic standing, disciplinary actions, and loan amounts to determine risk factors.

### Dataset

- `hogwarts_loan_data.csv` â€” 800 fictional student loan records with:
  - House, Blood Status, Loan Amount
  - Grade average, allowance, discipline
  - Binary `Defaulted` target variable

### Highlights

- Loan default likelihood by house and behavior
- Correlation and feature impact via XGBoost
- Comparison of logistic regression and boosting

### Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Feature importance visualization
- Classification metrics (precision, recall, F1)
